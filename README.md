## Technology stack/Requirements:
1. HTML.
2. CSS.
3. cdnjs.
4. Font Awesome.

## ABSTRACT:-
->>>. Shopify.com's layout, which makes extensive use of tags, paragraphs, headers, spans, and other elements, was created using HTML. With CSS, a website may be built to be both elegant and adaptable. I use the least amount of CSS possible to guarantee appropriate formatting when writing. All of the images used in this project were acquired from various sources, including Google, Amazon, Flipkart, and others. Furthermore, the CDNJS (CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK JS) provided amazing typographic icons.

## CDNJS:
dependable network for content delivery A vast array of popular web libraries, including Bootstrap and jQuery, are hosted by CDNJS to satisfy the needs of developers.
Definitely an essential tool for modern web development, with files delivered efficiently and swiftly.

## FONT AWESOME.
Font Awesome, the iconic font and CSS toolkit,
Empowers designers with a vast array of scalable icons,
From social media logos to UI elements sleek,
It enhances web aesthetics with its versatile streak,
A beloved resource, it's a designer's toolkit unique.
