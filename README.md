Hi, and thank you for visiting the Github source for my Shopify website. Customers may buy everyday necessities, cosmetics, sports equipment, and clothes for all ages from this online store by creating an account or logging in.

*** Shopify.com is the domain name that I gave my website ("This is not a clone of official shopify.com"). This is the only name I employed to identify my website.

## Technology stack/Requirements:
1. HTML.
2. CSS.
3. cdnjs.
4. Font Awesome.

## ABSTRACT:-
->>>. Shopify.com's layout, which makes extensive use of tags, paragraphs, headers, spans, and other elements, was created using HTML. With CSS, a website may be built to be both elegant and adaptable. I use the least amount of CSS possible to guarantee appropriate formatting when writing. All of the images used in this project were acquired from various sources, including Google, Amazon, Flipkart, and others. Furthermore, the CDNJS (CONTENT DILIVERY NETWORK JS) provided the amazing typographic icons.

## CDNJS:
CDNJS, a reliable content delivery network,
Hosts a vast array of popular libraries for the web,
From jQuery to Bootstrap, it caters to developers' needs,
With fast and efficient distribution of files at high speed,
A cornerstone resource for modern web development indeed.

## FONT AWESOME.
Font Awesome, the iconic font and CSS toolkit,
Empowers designers with a vast array of scalable icons,
From social media logos to UI elements sleek,
It enhances web aesthetics with its versatile streak,
A beloved resource, it's a designer's toolkit unique.
